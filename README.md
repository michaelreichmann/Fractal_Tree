# Fractal Tree

*Max 8.5*

This Max Patch creates and animates a fractal tree using jit.gl.mesh and JavaScript. 

The controls are:<br/>
**Initial Angle** of the branches<br/>
**Angle Offset**: animated offset of the branch angles<br/>

It is inspired by this tutorial by [The Coding Train](https://youtu.be/0jjeOYMjmDU).

The result looks like this:<br/>
